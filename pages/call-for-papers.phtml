		'abstract' => '"This idea is to help the users of the CloudStack to migrate their data across their Vm’s which are running in different hypervisors. Use Case: In CloudStack, when there are mixed hypervisors in the zone. When the user is having VM’s across multiple hypervisors. In CloudStack when User deploys a VM’s it will have only ROOT disk which contains the Operating System files. He creates DataDisk to store his files. When he creates the DataDisk and attaches to the user VM running on KVM host, then the disk format will be in qcow2. User will have the independence to detach and attach across his Vm’s running on KVM hypervisor type. But if the user wants to attach the same disk where his data id residing or download and upload to another zone where other hypervisors are running (xen, vmware, etc) as those hypervisors don’t understand the format he won’t be able to use his data disk. This situation can arise in case when he uploads his datadisk and there is no supported hypervisor present or not available for him to use. In case where he has two VM’s one on kvm and another on Xen, and xen went down for some reasons then he wants to use the same datadisk on kvm vm. One solution is to copy the data over network, but this will cause his the network bandwidth usage which may result in increasing his usage bill. One of the best ways is, let the cloudstack convert the image format according to the type of the hypervisor when he wants to migrate the datadisk. How it can work: 1. When user created a volume and attach to the VM (assume its running on KVM) then a volume will be created on the primary storage and it will copied to the secondary storage. Now the format of the datadisk will be in qcow2. 2. When the user wants to attach the disk to another VM running ( Xen/Vmware) then in the secondary storage duplicate the current volume and then find the virtual harddisk format supported by the hypervisor. 3. Convert the volume from qcow2 to the supported format of the hypervisor and then copy it to the primary storage and then attach to the VM. 4. To convert the image in the secondary storage VM (ssvm), it requires tools qemu-img or vboxmanage tools. If these tools are bundled with the ssvm template then this process can be achieved. With this process the User will get the independence to manage his datadisks across hypervisors in-case of using the same volume or in case of unavailability of the supported format hypervisor in the cloudstack management.

		'abstract' => '"This idea will help the cloud admin/user to deploy the Stack of instance which can act as his service solution. Use Case: Suppose cloud admin/user wants to deploy a web service portal and he has presentation template, logic tier template and database template. In the present situation, the user had to provision Vm from each template and then do the configuration so that they can logically act as one service stack. He has to create a network (deployVR) and then he has to deploy multiple instances from each template and then later configure them to act as one solution. This idea will help cloud admin/user to ease most of the above tedious tasks with an api call. We can introduce a new api called deployStack, which can take the argument such as template ids and count of instances from each template id, network offering id and rollback (true/false). deployStack api will perform the actions to validate the availability of resources depending of the requests. If there are resources, then it will first take care of implementing the network for this service stack, Once the network is ready then it will start creating the instances from each templates with the count param. Example, deployStack command receives templateid=1&count=3&templateid=2&count=2<br/>&templateid=3&count=1&networkofferingid=10&rollback=true CloudStack will look at all the params, first it will deploy a network (VR) using the networkofferingid 10 and then creates 3 instances from template id 1 and 2 instances from template id 2 and 1 instance from template id 3. All these instances will be running in the newly created network. And there will be an UUID for this stack which is used to manage later. For each operation, the result will get appended to the final job. If at any point of time if any of the operation fails, then it will check the rollback flag(true/false) if TRUE then it will rollback all the actions it had performed ( deleteing the VM’s, deleting the VR, Unimplement the network and clean up all the resources used). If FALSE, then it will not do clean up and send out a job result with fail and show the entire operations which are completed and failed one with the reason. From this point Admin/User will take care of what need to be done. Once the Job is successful then user will have his entire stack ready for configure and use his solution. If the Admin/User wants to delete this stack, he will just give the stack id then CS will take care of cleaning up entire resources which is created as part of deployStack. This will be a great helpful to cloud Admin/User. "'

Enomaly was among the first to develop a self-service infrastructure as a service IaaS platform ECP circa 2005, as well as SpotCloud 2011 the first commodity style cloud computing Spot Market. Today he leads Citrix NASDAQ: CTXS world wide cloud advocacy efforts with a particular focus on increasing the volume, reach and influence of Citrix extensive portfolio of cloud solutions used by more than 260,000 customers and 100 million end users across the globe.  Apart from Citrix Reuven writes The Digital Provocateur column for Forbes Magazine, is the co-founder of CloudCamp 300+ Cities around the Globe, an unconference where early adopters of Cloud Computing technologies exchange ideas and is the largest of the ‘barcamp’ style of events. He is also the co-host of the DigitalNibbles Podcast sponsored by Intel. He has served as a board member to the Information Technology Association of Canada as well as a strategic advisor to Sun Microsystems, Amazon, York University, The Government of Canadas Department of Foreign Affairs & International Trade DFAIT',
                'abstract' => 'This presentation will explore the emergence and rising potential of trading computing resources as commodities. Reuven will guide you through the recent history of trading exotic resources including past failures such as failed bandwidth markets Enron as well as the successes of the energy markets of 1990s ICE. The presentation provides a case study in how we might go about creating a successful commodity compute marketplace using CloudStack as a base.Thanks in part to the increasing popularity of cloud computing, the idea of just-in-time compute capacity has helped lower some of barriers that limited the previous bandwidth markets from flourishing. For many the concept of distributed batch processing and compute elasticity have become critical parts of modern business IT strategies. These kind of flexible and elastic compute usage models are ideally suited to that of a spot market for commodity compute capacity (provided via a method that is quoted for immediate spot settlement for both payment and delivery.  The notion of selling your excess compute capacity now has a poster child AWS this has lead to increased acceptance of selling excess compute resources using a commodities approach with several startups entering the space. This is in much the same way that Amazon EC2 has encouraged companies to use cloud like strategies within their internal systems private clouds. In a very real way, AWS is blazing a path for the broader industry. This presentation will focus on exploring how CloudStack could be used as the basis for the creation of cloud trading platform.'

His passion is collaboration-friendly design:  architectures that take care of the details and allow developers to contribute in parallel.',
                'abstract' => 'Adding Hyper-V support to CloudStack offered an opportunity to simplify plugin development. Traditionally, such plugins were created using Java and CloudStack-specific tools.  For instance, remote agents were easiest to write using CloudStack’s Java-based AgentShell. However, the Hyper-V effort shows that platform-specific tools and programming models can be used instead. For example, transporting commands over HTTP allows the bulk of the plugin to be written in C# rather than Java, and using QuickCloud avoids the need to portCloudStacks system VMs to Hyper-V. This session is useful to anyone writing a plugin.  The techniques for adding Hyper-V support can be applied elsewhere to help in plugin development.  In particular, plugin developers can use familiar APIs and tools to work faster.',
