	<h1><span>CIO Lunch Session – Getting ready to break the lock-in</span></h1>
	<p>At times, it can be quite frustrating to be CIO of a large company. You get your inspiration from companies that were born on the Internet or in the cloud. But your own business is up to its neck in end-of -life technology, a digital heritage which absorbs most of your budget. Moreover, you realize that future earnings of your organization depend heavily on digital innovation.</p>
	<p>You want to organize your infrastructure as a virtual network, enabling upscaling and downscaling, switching between clouds and your business at very low prices. Having this in place, you can experiment and innovate quickly, developing new online services an act as an incubator for your own business. To put it short, Apache Cloudstack  embodies a great promise to CIO’s that want to take their networkmanagement to the next level.</p>
	<p>But it takes guts to break the lock-in situation of legacy systems and start conversing to a new way of building your enterprise IT.<br/>Especially for CIO’s, we organize the CIO Lunch Session. At this meeting, we share experiences from other organizations, that struggled with the same challenges that you are facing. As you can expect from this open source peer-to-peer community, this session is not only about sharing successes but also discussing the pitfalls you should avoid.</p>
	<p>We will soon announce the names of the three speakers that come to have a talk with and share their experiences.</p>
